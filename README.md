# ZK-Jargon-Decoder-Flashcards
Repository containing Anki Flashcards &amp; source code to revise ZK terms from the ZK Jargon Decoder

## Introduction
This repository has taken definitions outlined in [ZK Jargon Decoder](https://zkjargon.github.io/) and put them into a form which can be easily learnt/revised using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> a cross platform app specifically designed for long term knowledge retention.

## Notes
Please note the modifications which have been made & where you can find updates.
1. The front of every card has "(ZK Jargon Decoder)" appended to the end so that if you have any other words in your collection, the ZK Jargon Decoder's Glossary definition will still be added when importing it.
2. The original relative URLs have been made into full URLs so they are clickable within Anki.
3. Unordered lists have been aligned to the left to make them easier to read in Anki which automatically centers content.
4. Any updates, translations or corrections to the deck will be available at <a href="https://github.com/darigovresearch/ZK-Jargon-Decoder-Flashcards">https://github.com/darigovresearch/ZK-Jargon-Decoder-Flashcards</a> so do return periodically to check if you have the latest version.

Feel free to share the deck and give the repository a star so more people are likely to see this work and can get the most out of it.

## Usage
If you want to just learn the words, download <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> on your device of choice and open the .apkg file to add it into your collection. If you wish to build the deck from scratch you will need to import the .csv file via the desktop with HTML enabled and the separator to be "|".

## Potential improvements yet to be made
1. To find a way to systematically pull the definitions from the glossary so that any corrections or additions are automatically updated.
2. To be able to automatically sort the cards so that the words which are used most in the glossary (or the documentation as a whole) is displayed first for the user to learn.
3. To translate the deck into different languages so people around the world can learn about the topic. All translations will be found in the link above & we are happy to incorporate any translations that have been submitted.
